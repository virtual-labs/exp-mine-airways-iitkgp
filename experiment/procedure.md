## Procedure

1. Dimension of the duct are noted with a measuring tape (length, breadth and height).
2. Inclined tube manometer is leveled and connected to the duct so that the pressure drop will be recorded.
3. As the air is following with a speed, the pressure drop is noted from inclined tube manometer.
4. At the same time, velocity of air flow is measured by continuous traverse of vane anemometer at one end of the duct.
5. A graph has to be plotted for the Î”P vs. (S V2 / A) values recorded for different air flow rates. The frictional coefficient will be calculated from the slope of the grape. In this way the frictional coefficient will be determined graphically from the above experimented result.

## Simulation Procedure

The following procedure is to be followed by the user in order to determine the friction coefficient of a duct:
